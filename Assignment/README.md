# Assignment Solutions

You could find solutions according to the assignment numbers, since [POJ](http://poj.org/) is a classical online judgement website and owns a long history, which only support ```c99```, ```c++98``` and ```JDK 6```, you must pay attention to the sols.

If you find this it annoying, you could choose [ZOJ](https://zoj.pintia.cn/) to finish the same question since it includes most problem in POJ and supports ```c99```, ```c++14``` and ```python3```.
