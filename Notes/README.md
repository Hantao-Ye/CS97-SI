# Notes

Most contents come from the slides, you could find them in [this link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/)

You may think it is wired to "simply copy the same contents" from teachers' materials, personally speaking, the time that I spent on reading and organizing notes could help me to understand the contents as well as the finished notes help me to review the knowledge.
