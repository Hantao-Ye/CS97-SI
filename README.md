# CS97 SI

This is the personal recording of the Stanford course CS 97SI: Introduction to Programming Contests, where the relevant information including **slides** and **homework** could be found on this [link](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs97si/).

I would take in markdown notes as well as uploading my solution to the homework in this repository.

## Contribute Struggle in BJTU

Struggle in BJTU is a project that I've created, sharing notes and relevant readings for MECE students in BJTU, aims at providing help as much as possible in learning.

Since I've already finished most courses in BJTU ~~and the habit of keeping notes origins from learning in home during COVID-19~~, now I could only cover the last half period in BJTU
